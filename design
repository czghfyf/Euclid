Command packet structure.
Command packet is a byte array, the bytes-order is low-byte on front. The first 4 bytes of this array represent the capacity of the entire data packet.
For example, consider the following array with 16 bytes:
0x10 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xA7 0x09 0xAA 0xCD 0xCC 0xDD 0xEE 0xFF 0x00 0x01 0xAC 0xBD
The first 4 bytes (0x10 0x00 0x00 0x00) represent an int type value 16, indicates the capacity of the entire command packet.
The next 12 bytes represent a command, the two bytes (0xA7 0x09) represent the command type, and the next 10 bytes (start with 0xAA) represent the specific command content.

Express intent(CT_INTENT):
0th to 3rd bytes (0x08 0x00 0x00 0x00) represent the capacity of the entire data packet.
4th to 5rd bytes (0x00 0x00) command type is express intent.
6th to 7rd bytes (0x00 0x00) The party requesting the connection is the client program.
				 (0x01 0x00) The party requesting the connection is another Euclid service node.

Agree(CT_AGREE):
0th to 3rd bytes (0x06 0x00 0x00 0x00) data packet capacity.
4th to 5rd bytes (0x01 0x00) agree.

Establish node connection(CT_GO_TO_JOIN_CLUSTER):
 0th to  3rd bytes (0x0C 0x00 0x00 0x00) data packet capacity.
 4th to  5rd bytes (0x02 0x00) Connect to an other Euclid service node and become its child node.
 6th to  9rd bytes - parent Euclid service node IP.
10th to 11rd bytes - parent Euclid service node port.

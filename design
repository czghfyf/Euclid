Command packet structure.
Command packet is a byte array, the bytes-order is low-byte on front. The first 4 bytes of this array represent the capacity of the entire data packet.
For example, consider the following array with 16 bytes:
0x10 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xA7 0x09 0xAA 0xCD 0xCC 0xDD 0xEE 0xFF 0x00 0x01 0xAC 0xBD
The first 4 bytes (0x10 0x00 0x00 0x00) represent an int type value 16, indicates the capacity of the entire command packet.
The next 12 bytes represent a command, the two bytes (0xA7 0x09) represent the command type, and the next 10 bytes (start with 0xAA) represent the specific command content.

Express intent(CT_INTENT):
0th to 3rd bytes - (0x08 0x00 0x00 0x00) represent the capacity of the entire data packet.
4th to 5rd bytes - (0x00 0x00) command type is express intent.
6th to 7rd bytes - (0x00 0x00) The party requesting the connection is the client program.
				   (0x01 0x00) The party requesting the connection is another Euclid service node.

Agree(CT_AGREE):
0th to 3rd bytes - (0x06 0x00 0x00 0x00) data packet capacity.
4th to 5rd bytes - (0x01 0x00) agree.

Establish node connection(CT_GO_TO_JOIN_CLUSTER):
 0th to  3rd bytes - (0x1A 0x00 0x00 0x00) data packet capacity.
 4th to  5rd bytes - (0x02 0x00) Connect to an other Euclid service node and become its child node.
 6th to 21rd bytes - a string that the parent Euclid service node IP.
22th to 25rd bytes - int - the parent Euclid service node port.

Disconnect(FIXC_DISCONNECT):
0th to 3rd bytes - (0x06 0x00 0x00 0x00) data packet capacity.
4th to 5rd bytes - (0x03 0x00) TCP disconnect.

Done(FIXC_DONE):
0th to 3rd bytes - (0x06 0x00 0x00 0x00) data packet capacity.
4th to 5rd bytes - (0x04 0x00) done.

Create a dimension (CREATE_DIMENSION):
0th to  3rd bytes - data packet capacity.
4th to  5rd bytes - (0x05 0x00) create a dimension(not measure dimension) in root master node of euclid cluster.
6th to last bytes - dimension name(UTF-8).
